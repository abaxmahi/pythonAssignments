#Perform Basic mathematical Operatrions
# Write a python program that does the following:
#1.Takes two numbers as input from the user.

number1 =  int(input("Enter the first number: "))
number2 = int(input("Enter the 2nd number: "))

#2. perform basic op on these numbers

Addition = number1 + number2
Subtraction = number1 - number2
Multiplication = number1 * number2
Division = number1 / number2
#3. display the result
print("Addition: sum is : ",Addition)
print("Subtraction: difference is: ",Subtraction)
print("Multiplication: Product is: ",Multiplication)
print("division: Quotient is: ",Division)
